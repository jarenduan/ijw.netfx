A few nuget packages provide extensions and helpers for .Net Core and .Net Frameworks. 

# Repro structure
there're 3 folders in the repro:

  1. `pkg`: output nuget packages.

  2. `src`: source codes.

  3. `test`: all test projects.

# pkg
Use `src/packall.bat` to build all the projects into nuget packages
